This repository contains resources, slides, and references related to the presentation: **"Applying Interpretable Machine Learning in Computational Biology—Pitfalls, Recommendations, and Opportunities"**.

## Overview
Interpretable Machine Learning (IML) aims to make machine learning models transparent and their predictions understandable. This project explores how IML methods can be applied to computational biology, discussing their importance, common pitfalls, and future opportunities, particularly in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Content
- **Slides**: [Link to the presentation slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAGXgdDQSIU/JVpwEty1QNwGj7fChbSeaQ/edit?utm_content=DAGXgdDQSIU&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)
- **Key Topics Covered**:
  - What is IML?
  - Overview of IML methods (Post Hoc and By-Design)
  - Evaluation metrics for interpretability
  - Common pitfalls in IML applications
  - Opportunities and recommendations for advancing IML in biology
- **Figures**: Examples and visualizations from the presentation, including real-world applications like DCell and Enformer.
- **References**: Citations from the presentation in APA format.

## Key Features
- Discussion on LIME, SHAP, DeepLIFT, and attention mechanisms.
- Insights into biologically informed neural networks like DCell, P-NET, and KPNN.
- Challenges and future directions for IML in LLMs, including tokenization, multimodal data, and visualization tools.
